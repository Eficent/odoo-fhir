    #     Used to record detailed information pertinent to a clinician's assessment and assertion

    #     This resource is used to record detailed information about a clinician's assessment and assertion 
    #     of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It is intended for use to record information 
    #     about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic 
    #     and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that 
    #     require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern), or identification of 
    #     health issues/situations considered harmful, potentially harmful and required to be investigated 
    #     and managed (problems).

    #     The condition resource may also be used to record certain health state of a patient 
    #     which does not normally present negative outcome (until complications are predicted or detected), 
    #     e.g. pregnancy. Examples of complications of pregnancy include: hyperemesis gravidarum, 
    #     preeclampsia, eclampsia - which are captured as problems/diagnoses.

        A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. 
        
        **Scope and Usage**

        Condition is one of the event resources in the FHIR workflow specification.

        This resource is used to record detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept 
        that has risen to a level of concern. The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s 
        Problem List, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s Problem List. Often times, a condition is about a clinician's assessment 
        and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application 
        of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers 
        harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management 
        (health issue/concern). 
        
        The condition resource may be used to record a certain health state of a patient which does not normally present a negative outcome, e.g. pregnancy. 
        The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation procedure. 
        
        While conditions are frequently a result of a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health, 
        conditions can also be expressed by the patient, related person, or any care team member. A clinician may have a concern about a patient condition (e.g. anorexia) 
        that the patient is not concerned about. Likewise, the patient may have a condition (e.g. hair loss) that does not rise to the level of importance 
        such that it belongs on a practitioner’s Problem List. 
        
        For example, each of the following conditions could rise to the level of importance such that it belongs on a problem or concern list due to its 
        direct or indirect impact on the patient’s health. These examples may also be represented using other resources, such as FamilyMemberHistory, Observation, or Procedure.
